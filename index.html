          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The !DOCTYPE declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS applies a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS style sheets contain CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, allowing it to affect multiple elements.</li>
          <li>Selectors define the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property and the vaile of the property.</li>
          <li>The margin property indicates how much space is around the outside of an element and it acts like a buffer.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The CSS box model views every HTML element as a box.</li>
          <li>Each box consists of margins outside the element, the element's borders, paddigns inside the element, and the contents.</li>
          <li>The * selector declared that all elements on the page will be affected by its style.</li>
          <li>Using a comma allows to combine two selectors into a single CSS rule, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>Combining selectors helps with writing Do Not Repeat Yourself, or DRY, code.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that keeps track of multipule versions of a project.</li>
          <li>Git commands can be used in the Command Line Interface, or CLI, to save and track versions of code.</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, you can initiate a repository, add code to the repository, and view different versions of the code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>There are approximately 37 Git commands to use.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that stores data for code.</li>
          <li>Keywords are used to declare JavaScript code, like how var declares a variable.</li>
          <li>The = sign is an assignment operator, used to assign specific data into a container, most likely a variable.</li>
          <li>Semicolons are usually placed at the end of a line of code to signify its end.</li>
          <li>Strings are used to store data that is usually not numerical, however, it can store numerical values as well.</li>
          <li>The function console.log is used to output a message to the web console.</li>
          <li>Chrome DevTools can be used to view the web console, showing messages that console.log had created.</li>
          <li>An if statement is used to execute code when the appropriate conditions are met.</li>
          <li>An else if statement is used to execute code only when the previous if or else if statement's conditions weren't met.</li>
          <li>An else statement is used to execute code only after all previous if and else if statement's conditions weren't met.</li>
          <li>The === signs is the strict equality operator, which checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Booleen result of true or false depending on the results.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, typically data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>An array can contain multiple types of variables at once, like strings, Booleans, and numbers.</li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential, meaning the starting variable type will be 0, and increments by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>A for loop is a single code block that can be executed multiple times until it either exhausts its loop, or is stopped by another type of code.</li>
          <li>A for loop consists of 3 parts: a starting point, a condition, and a iterating operator.</li>
          <li>For loops are commonly used to sort out or go through an array.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>To use a created function, call the function by writing it as a line of code.</li>
          <li>The Math function can be used to create random number generators.</li>
          <li>Math.floor and Math.random are two examples of Math functions.</li>
