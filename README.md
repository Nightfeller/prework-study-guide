## Usage

Each section has notes on its own topic. These topics are: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
If you don't know what to do first, you can open Chrome's console for a suggestion. To open the console, first open Chrome DevTools by right-clicking the webpage and selecting "Inspect". You can also open DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I or Control+Shift+I for macOS and Windows respectively.
After opening Chrome DevTools, locate the console panel, which should be either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. If your not on the console, locate the "Console" button, which should be at the top of the console panel.
There, you will see a list of topics that are learned from prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
